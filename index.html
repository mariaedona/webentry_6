        <p>Your group will be choosing a museum to visit. It is preferred that you visit public museums since it has minimal entrance fee and free within October (Museum Month). You will create a vlog narrating your visit to that particular museum. The selection of the museum to be visited is first choose, first serve basis since there are a lot of places to visit within NCR. If you need to submit certain documents with my signature, inform me asap. The vlog is good for 10 mins. The following must be seen in the vlog:
            <br>
            - Journey going to the museum
            <br>
            - Clip outside the museum and photos inside (if the curator does not allow taking short videos)
            <br>
            - Exhibits and memorabilia that interests you the most
            <br>
            - Outro reflection (summary of what you have learned during the tour)
